    "\n",
    "It is October 2018. The squirrels in Central Park are running into a problem and we need your help.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project you must go through most steps in the checklist. You must write responses for all items however sometimes the item will simply be \"does not apply\". Some of the parts are a bit more nebulous and you simply show that you have done things in general (and the order doesn't really matter). Keep your progress and thoughts organized in this document and use formatting as appropriate (using markdown to add headers and sub-headers for each major part). Do not do the final part (launching the product) and your presentation will be done as information written in this document in a dedicated section, no slides or anything like that. It should however include the best summary plots/graphics/data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are intentionally given very little information thus far. You must communicate with your client (me) for additional information as necessary. But also make sure that your communications are efficient, thought out, and not redundant as your client might get frustrated and \"fire\" you (this only applies to getting information from your client, this does not necessary apply to asking for help with the actual project itself - you should continuously ask questions for getting help).\n",
    "\n",
    "You must submit all data files and a pickled preprocessor and final model along with this notebook."
